### The Person

I'm a Colorado native who was born in the weird cusp between the GenX and Millennial generations. I grew up analog and then figured out how to master the digital realm. To this day, however, I still love a good Moleskine as much as I love code. I live in Denver with my husband, who's a chef and pretty rad, and two shiba inus, a giant Bengal cat who's into everything, and a gray shorthair cat who's sassy and purrs all day.

I call myself an introvert with social skills. I grew up _exceptionally_ nerdy and weird and quiet, and somewhere in my late 20s I kind of figured out how to engage with people socially. I really couldn't speak to what happened exactly, but there it is.

I enjoy doing things in a big way: Hiking 14,000 foot mountains, racing cars, crafting batch cocktails that will bring down a whole party within hours, making green chili that you'll eat out of spite and joy all at once, and giving talks where two years later people still bring up that it was clear I put a _lot_ of thought into my GIF choices.

### The Blog

I was watching a talk and of course I can't find the link. But the speaker (who was actually typing the entire time and didn't say a word) pointed out if you don't know what to talk about, you aren't doing enough writing. And if you don't know what to write about, you aren't doing enough reading. I agonize constantly over my writing not being that great, which is a vortex that's easy to get stuck in forever and ever. I realized I just need to go for it. So here we are.

This blog is loosely tech-related. It's my industry but I am a person first and a developer second (or fourth, or eighteenth depending on the day). Most likely there will be a mix of things, from tech, to career, to diversity, to fitness, to nurtition, to professional development, to self actualization, and anything in between.

### The Past

We got the internet (not AOL) in the summer of 1998, right before my junior year of high school. As a weird artistic kid in rural Colorado, I was sucked in right away. I taught myself HTML over Spring Break my junior year, because that's what you do when you live in a town with one traffic light and don't have a car. I spent a ton of time building personal sites as well as fan sites for bands like Blur, Travis, and Oasis. I remember being a huge fan of what Radiohead was doing in 1999 with their integrated marketing campaigns leading up to Kid A and the websites that Stanley Donwood was building for them. That became a major influence on how I designed and built static sites. It wound up getting me fanmail from the bands themselves. I wish I'd kept all those correspondances and screen shots of previous efforts. For limited capabilities of HTML inside of Anglefire and Tripod, it wasn't bad.

In addition to learning web markup, I spent a lot of time in Photoshop and Quark XPress. I became my school's yearbook design manager and then its editor. At 17 I was receiving a lot of mentorship from teachers on design and leadership. I credit those teachers, specifically Steve Zanetti and Julie Brand, with a lot of seed planting.

After high school I scrapped college for various reasons and went down a very '00s path of graphic design: Static websites, business cards, letterheads, sales flyers, magazine layouts, signmaking, etc.

In 2010 I was totally in over my head with managing a broken team and working 60 hour weeks at a print shop an hour from my house. I needed out. I remembered my web background. I gut checked with my husband, who'd been a computer science major in college in the early 90s, and enrolled at community college for a developer certificate program. I worked full time and took 12 credit hours and finished in 2 semesters. It was the approximate workload of a boot camp, but without relevant technology (for example I was docked for using a jQuery carousel on a Javascript project and we never learned a thing about the console).

### The Present

I currently work for Charter Communications in Denver as a Senior UI Prototype Architect. This is by far the longest job title I've held. I started as a full-stack .NET developer but, either because of my design roots or just because, I gravitated toward front end starting around 2014, once I overcame my crippling fear of Javascript. Machines talking to machines never blew my skirt up, if you will. The idea of solving human problems with design centric approaches, however, really did it for me. When I was learning to program I had no idea what user experience design was, and really until recently didn't have a terrific grasp on how it's not the same as visual or UI design. Then I took an evening class at General Assembly and that demystified those approaches for me. I always considered myself a user advocate and this closed the loop on what I'd been wanting to craft my career around but could never fully articulate.

The job I do now is a terrific blend of UX and development. I get to solve problems rapidly, putting the user first, and I get to do it with code. Working within a capable Design team and getting to straddle this chasm has been a dream for a long time, and it's pretty exciting to see this manifest in my career.

### The Future

I'm a big goal oriented person, but somewhere in adulting a lot of that got lost for a while. My attempts to reclaim it are part of why this thing even exists. For me, career engagement extends beyond my day job, and this is a pretty normal thing for developers, but it's all in the method.

I've never had a desire to contribute to OSS. I also don't buy into the mindset that only developers with active Github profiles are worth hiring. This is a question I've had a lot. Pretty much since I started as a developer, my goal has been more on the educational and human interaction path. No big surprise; it ties in neatly with my user centered development approaches.

I found out organically that I _love_ speaking. For 2018 I aim to speak at least once a month. I'm already well on my way with a Galvanize cohort in January and [DenverScript](https://www.meetup.com/DenverScript/) in February. Up until this point I've gone to speak if asked and filled out exactly three CFPs in my life (1: accepted, 1: declined, and 1: TBD). However, I have not made a point to aggressively seek out opportunities. My hope is through writing more, it will add to my cycle of engagement in the local, national, and international development community and become a self fueling mechanism by which I can grow myself as well as contribute to the growth of others.
