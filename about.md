### The Person

I'm a Colorado native who was born in the weird cusp between the GenX and Millennial generations. I grew up analog and then figured out how to master the digital realm. To this day, however, I still love a good Moleskine as much as I love code. I live in Denver with my husband, who's a chef and pretty rad, and two shiba inus, a giant Bengal cat who's into everything, and a gray shorthair cat who's sassy and purrs all day.

I call myself an introvert with social skills. I grew up _exceptionally_ nerdy and weird and quiet, and somewhere in my late 20s I kind of figured out how to engage with people socially. I really couldn't speak to what happened exactly, but there it is.

I enjoy doing things in a big way: Hiking 14,000 foot mountains, racing cars, crafting batch cocktails that will bring down a whole party within hours, making green chili that you'll eat out of spite and joy all at once, and giving talks where two years later people still bring up that it was clear I put a _lot_ of thought into my GIF choices.

### The Blog

I was watching a talk and of course I can't find the link. But the speaker (who was actually typing the entire time and didn't say a word) pointed out if you don't know what to talk about, you aren't doing enough writing. And if you don't know what to write about, you aren't doing enough reading. I agonize constantly over my writing not being that great, which is a vortex that's easy to get stuck in forever and ever. I realized I just need to go for it. So here we are.

### The Past

We got the internet (not AOL) in the summer of 1998, right before my junior year of high school. As a weird artistic kid in rural Colorado, I was sucked in right away. I taught myself HTML over Spring Break my junior year, because that's what you do when you live in a town with one traffic light and don't have a car. I spent a ton of time building personal sites as well as fan sites for bands like Blur, Travis, and Oasis. I remember being a huge fan of what Radiohead was doing in 1999 with their integrated marketing campaigns leading up to Kid A and the websites that Stanley Donwood was building for them. That became a major influence on how I designed and built static sites. It wound up getting me fanmail from the bands themselves. I wish I'd kept all those correspondances and screen shots of previous efforts. For limited capabilities of HTML inside of Anglefire and Tripod, it wasn't bad.

In addition to learning web markup, I spent a lot of time in Photoshop and Quark XPress. I became my school's yearbook design manager and then its editor. At 17 I was receiving a lot of mentorship from teachers on design and leadership. I credit those teachers, specifically Steve Zanetti and Julie Brand, with a lot of seed planting.

After high school I scrapped college for various reasons and went down a very 00s path down graphic design: Design of static websites and sales flyers, business cards, signs, magazine layouts, and so on.

In 2010 I was totally in over my head with managing a broken team and working 60 hour weeks at a print shop an hour from my house. I needed out. I remembered my web background. I gut checked with my husband, who'd been a computer science major in college in the early 90s, and enrolled at community college for a developer certificate program. I worked full time and took 12 credit hours and finished in 2 semesters. It would the approximate workload of a boot camp, but without relevant technology. Fortunately, my ability to network and my previous experience in design helped me land work quickly. I switched jobs a lot during that time. It was never my intention to hop companies with a set degree of frequency, but in rediscovering a career path, and in a field where I feel the standards of skill is very high, I struggled with finding where I fit in my own field.
