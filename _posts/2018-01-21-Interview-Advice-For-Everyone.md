I recently went to speak at a gSchool cohort which is always a great experience.

This particular cohort really went above and beyond with thoughtful questions and engagement after I left. One of them asked me what I look for when I interview engineers. I put together what I thought would be a pretty quick answer on LinkedIn and sent it off to him.

I have a habit of reading back over my messages after I have sent them. It's like having a mini retro on how effectively I felt I communicated the point(s) I wanted to get across. This one felt like it was worthy of a copy-pasta on the blog.

When I interview candidates, and specifically junior engineers, I look for a couple of key factors:

- Effective articulation. This job involves a LOT of communication: Explaining logic and thought patterns (to peers, seniors, managers, nontechnical folks, etc), working through things in a pair/team, attending meetings, and even code itself is a form of communication. I want to see people who are thoughtful and can explain a concept effectively, whether it is technical or just being able to tell me what brought them to the technical field and what excites them about it.

- Some level of technical knowledge. As in, knowing CSS is not a framework. Being able to talk about and begin working through a problem. Explaining what was done and why if there is a take-home coding exercise. Places say "We can teach the tech" and I believe there is some truth in that but probably as you've seen, if you start with a clean slate there is a LOT to overcome and companies can't invest _that_ much into a new hire. There needs to be some demonstrated groundwork and core competence; that is the foundation I want to work from.

- Humility. This is a core value of a lot of engineering teams. I have worked with what I call the Talented Jerk many, many times, at all skill levels. Go in assuming you know less than you think you do; that's where real growth happens. Always know you and your code can improve. This is different from a "I suck and everything I touch turns to shit" mentality. This is "I give everything my best and I'm always open to improving" which keeps you motivated and keeps people wanting to work with you.

- A team oriented mindset. I always think "Hmm would I want to pair with this person on fixing a production app or a really hard problem?" If I get the impression they'd get frustrated and shut down within 10 minutes, that is a red flag. If someone has a mindset of being curious, mindful, etc those are people I like to solve problems with. Along with the humility part.

- Thoughtfulness. This seems obvious but I have talked to candidates who gave me such short, one-dimensional answers to questions (see the list I use below) that I was fighting to try and engage them as well as figure out how to chew up even 20 minutes of time. Figure out how to add detail to your answers, how to expand on ideas, etc. We need this as a technical and "soft" skill in engineering teams.

Also for the record here are interview questions I almost always ask of candidates:
- What made you decide to start going to `program || boot camp || whatever`?
- What surprised you the most about the process there?
- What's the best project you worked on? Why? (bonus points if I can skip the "why" part and go right into it)
- What's the most frustrating project you worked on? Why? (same as above on the "why" part)
- What do you want to learn next?
- Have you thought about long-term goals in your new technical career and if so, what are they?
- What questions do you have for me? (ALWAYS come with questions. Take 10 minutes, that's all it takes, and look up the company interviewing you online. See if they have a tech blog or other things that give you a starting point.)

Also for bonus here are questions I feel may be effective for YOU (the candidate).
First off, try to lead in with a core value for you. This gives the interviewer context. The second sentence is the question. The value sentences I give below are just suggestions, find what is true to you. Like this:

- I am enthusiastic about working with others and want to make sure I don't get pushed into a corner with my laptop and no support. What does your mentorship of junior engineers look like?

- I want to be able to grow my career and not only through job hopping every year or two in order to accomplish that. Do you have communicated information for your team on what junior/mid/senior look like and how people can advance?

- I think it's important to be engaged with the dev community and also know what is happening with tech. What does support for attending local or national conferences look like? (examples: Denver or Boulder Startup Week, Develop Denver, NGConf, JSConf, etc).

- If you could change one thing about the company, what would it be?

- What is one question I haven't asked here that you think I should?

I think the last two questions you should ALWAYS ask. The others, feel free to add/subtract/adjust. Find questions that map to a core value that is important to you as a person.
