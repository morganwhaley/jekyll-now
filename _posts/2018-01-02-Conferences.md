title: Conferences, aka the Collective Energy of Large Groups and Free Stuff
---

It wasn't until about 2016 that I found out companies would pay to send me to other cities to learn amazing things. My first foray into conferencing what when I worked at LivingSocial. I attended F8 in San Francisco with my Director and a couple other coworkers.

First off, Facebook know how to put together a conference. The free swag was spectacular (best thing was the down Patagonia vest) and there were snack stations everywhere stocked with gummy bears, protein bars, Red Bull, LaCroix, Coca Cola, and water. They operated a free breakfast and lunch buffet each day. They brought in ice cream carts. They had set up a museum devoted to the evolution of communication. Somewhere in there The Zuck did the keynote, and the Lead Scientist from Oculus was there, and in two days I came away convinced that Facebook could actually solve all of my life and work problems.

Years ago I read a book that had a great line: "Be a filter, not a sponge." I think it was relevant to the best way to digest Ayn Rand's writings but on the last day of the conference, when my Director and I had had enough and played hookie from the closing remarks to run to Fisherman's Wharf to watch the sea lions, the haze of free food and sugary drinks began to fade and I realized that This Is How They Get You at conferences. You get all fired up like a motherfucker like "YEAH! FACEBOOK MESSENGER WILL FIX E-COMMERCE FOREVER! HRRRGGGGHHHH!!!"

The second conference I went to was Grace Hopper 2016 in Houston. And again, fired up as HELL. That is a conference that will force you to experience a full gamut of emotions all day every day you are there. Also, I easily racked up 20,000 steps a day in Houston. Also, it was hot. Also, LivingSocial laid off many people that week, so there were additional feels to heap on top of the feels I got from seeing people like Brianna Wu and Sheryl Sandberg speak about diversity, inclusion, empowerment, and support.

I've been to several other conferences since those inaugural two in 2016 and always really enjoy them.

As 2018 fires up, and I've settled into Charter's Design team a bit more, I'm thinking heavily on what I want for myself conference-wise this year. I've pitched a couple of talks, one was rejected, another is TBD. But the juicy stuff around my speaking is for another blog post. Outside of that I enjoy being an attendee and feeling that collective "FUCK YES!!" that comes with conferencing. Even if the stardust haze clears after a couple of hours, I enjoy flexing that muscle that gets really, _really_ excited about an idea/person/approach.

We don't have set guidelines for conferences so I'm looking at factors outside of budget, such as:  
- Personal and career alignment
- Won't kill me from a travel pov (2017 did that already)
- If the takeaways are worth presenting back to Design here, which is very much A Thing
- Would I want to speak there next year/year after/in 10 years
- Can I consolidate with other things such as personal trips, speaking at a local meetup in $otherCity, etc

Here's to 2018 and getting fired up! And also lots of stickers, t-shirts, blankets, vests, coozies, lapel pins, coffee mugs, pens, and snacks!
